- 2026-08-05 — Old repo's cleanup VERIFIED; dedicated conda env `pokemon-showdown-rl` created

  Final sweep of deep-rl-from-scratch after its close-out push (6 commits, tip
  `aa033dd`, clean tree): code grep for showdown/poke_env across .py/.toml/.yaml/.sh —
  zero hits; every retained md doc (README, PLAN, PLAN_ARCHIVE, SESSION_LOGS, STATUS,
  CLAUDE) — zero 'showdown' mentions. Their cleanup claim is TRUE and goes further
  than their own removal manifest recommended: the Phase-5 narrative was scrubbed from
  the working docs, so **the old repo's capstone log entries / Phase 5 spec now exist
  only in its git history** (pushed, so durable — `git show <pre-strip>:SESSION_LOGS.md`
  there if primary sources are ever needed). Their README carries no forwarding link
  to this repo. Nothing in their six final commits contained capstone material we
  lacked. Their close-out also confirmed the shared-env hazard from their side: two
  repos both shipping a top-level `rl` package must not share an env (first `.pth`
  alphabetically wins, silent wrong-tree imports — measured).

  Env migration (maintainer removed `deep-rl` with `conda env remove`): created
  `/opt/anaconda3/envs/pokemon-showdown-rl` (Python 3.13), `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
  from pinned pyproject. Verified: `import rl` resolves here from a neutral cwd;
  torch 2.13.0 and poke_env import; offline suite `288 passed, 8 warnings`. CLAUDE.md
  env section updated (name, recreate line, one-env-per-repo warning); the only other
  deep-rl mentions in live docs are provenance naming, left alone.

- 2026-08-05 — Git history imported: the capstone lineage is now this repo's `main`

  Executed the approved plan. Cloned the old repo (222 commits) into the scratchpad;
  `filter-branch` keep-list = rl/ scripts/ tests/ configs/ assets/ prior_work/
  pyproject.toml .gitignore DESIGN_P7.md with --prune-empty; squashed baseline commit
  built from the parent of the first capstone commit (old `0ef4775` "Phase 5 env
  plumbing", 2026-07-29); grafted and baked. Result: **baseline + 41 capstone-era
  commits = 42** (49 of the 90 capstone-era commits touched only dropped doc paths and
  pruned away); tip `f8ca9b6` = old `57a93e5` ("P6 COMPLETE"). Fidelity verified:
  kept paths of the filtered tip are byte-identical to old HEAD `61752d4` (empty diff).
  Fetched into this repo as `main`, index reset to HEAD; the working tree now carries
  exactly the bootstrap diff (pyproject rewrite, DESIGN_P7.md → DESIGN.md with
  revisions, logging.py WANDB_PROJECT fix, six new docs) — bootstrap commit lands when
  asked. Old-repo commit hashes resolve only in the archive; hashes are strict from
  here on.

- 2026-08-05 — PORT VERIFICATION PASSED (8/8, measured) — old-repo strip AUTHORIZED

  All eight MIGRATION.md checks reproduced their recorded numbers; MIGRATION.md,
  start.md and PORT_VERIFICATION_HANDOFF.md deleted per their own lifecycle rules.
  Measured results:

  1. Provenance: `rl.__file__` → this repo from a neutral cwd, re-verified at the end.
     Gotcha for the record: the new dist name does not displace the old editable
     install — required an explicit `pip uninstall deep-rl-from-scratch` after
     `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.
  2. Independence: zero functional old-repo references (only the exempt pyproject
     provenance comment). Re-verified at the end.
  3. Offline suite: exactly `288 passed, 8 warnings` (needs the server up — two
     server-gated tests in test_collect.py; first run without it: 286 + 2 skipped).
  4. Full suite: `318 passed, 8 warnings`, zero failures; known flake did not fire.
  5. BC val agreement, recomputed from checkpoints over the reconstructed battle-level
     split: 0.901660 / 0.898744 / 0.904674 — bit-identical to recorded; val rows
     90242 / 89955 / 89797 match.
  6. Live smoke (runs/migration_smoke, 4k steps): clean connect/train/eval/exit, all
     seven locked metric keys in history.csv.
  7. Throughput (runs/migration_tput, 150k steps, single lane, maintainer terminal):
     median 733.8 steps/s over last 90% (bar >659 — `simulator: 4` operative);
     collect/update split 94.7/5.3.
  8. Ported clone finals via score_ladder (1000 battles/seed, maintainer terminal):
     0.460 / 0.455 / 0.482, pooled 1397/3000 = 0.4657 vs recorded 0.4530 (~1σ);
     every band condition met. JSONs: runs/bc_p4_512_40k_s*/migration_check8.json.

  Flagged decision for the strip (not a blocker): the old repo's milestone-1/2 run
  dirs (showdown_heur*, showdown_maxbp, showdown_mix512, showdown_sp6m, shakeouts,
  tput probes) were NOT copied — judged superseded (numbers live in the old repo's
  retained docs). Their deletion is a maintainer decision, not an accident. Also open:
  whether to adapt the old repo's doc-archaeologist agent here.

  GIT HISTORY IMPORT PLAN (approved 2026-08-05; preserved from MIGRATION.md before its
  deletion): import the capstone's commit lineage as this repo's root. Shape:
  path-filter to the ported files (rl/, scripts/, tests/, configs/, pyproject.toml,
  .gitignore, DESIGN_P7.md) AND cut at capstone start (~2026-07-25), one squashed
  baseline commit ("harness as inherited at capstone start"), genuine capstone-era
  commits on top, bootstrap committed above that (when asked). Mechanics: clone the
  old repo into the scratchpad, filter the CLONE (old repo untouched — its .git keeps
  full history even after the working-tree strip), fetch the filtered branch here as
  `main`, `git reset --mixed` so the tree diff vs imported HEAD is the bootstrap.
  Accepted: hashes rewrite once at import, strict thereafter; no history-wide
  personal-details audit (rule relaxed 2026-08-05).

- 2026-08-04 — Repo bootstrapped from deep-rl-from-scratch

  Copied per start.md §2 while the old repo's 6-lane P6 run was live (old repo treated
  as read-only; file reads only): `rl/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `configs/`, `prior_work/`,
  `assets/`, `DESIGN_P7.md`, `.gitignore`, `runs/bc_p4_512_40k_s{0,1,2}`, `data/`
  (3.6GB), `showdown/` (286M, `simulator: 4` verified at `config/config.js:111`).
  Excluded `__pycache__`/`.pytest_cache`/`.DS_Store`. Old repo's markdown docs NOT
  copied by design — their durable content is distilled into this repo's CLAUDE.md /
  STATUS.md / README.md.

  Rewrote `pyproject.toml` (name `pokemon-showdown-rl`; pins unchanged — spine code and
  tests still import gymnasium/minatar/mujoco/open_spiel; deps prune with the spine).
  Wrote CLAUDE.md (charter, environment, landmines, conventions), STATUS.md (60-line
  cap), README.md. Per start.md's later edit: the design doc is the roadmap; STATUS.md
  points at it instead of restating it.

  Renamed `DESIGN_P7.md` → `DESIGN.md` (maintainer call: fresh repo, no old-repo phase
  names). Inside the doc: proposal arms P7a/b/c → Arms A/B/C; P4/P5/P5b/P6 kept — they
  name the predecessor's measured experiments (a naming note says so). Also fixed
  now-stale old-repo references: "no RL libraries by hard rule" in §1, the PLAN.md
  lifecycle line, the §10 Metamon governance paragraph (rule retired here; provenance +
  pinning is what binds), and the absolute ps-ppo path (now `../ps-ppo`). Revision 4
  note in the doc records this; no measured number or claim changed.

  start.md gained §8b (port verification, 7 checks with recorded numbers to reproduce).
  Ran check 1's diagnostic early: `import rl` from this root resolves here only via cwd
  shadowing — the env's editable install is still `__editable__.deep_rl_from_scratch`
  pointing at the old repo. Fix (`pip install -e ".[dev]"`) is pip and therefore waits
  for the all-clear; it should also wait for the old repo's P6 finals, which import
  `rl` and would otherwise resolve to this repo's copy mid-run. Checks 2–7 pending.

  Created MIGRATION.md (maintainer call): carries §8b's seven checks + recorded numbers,
  the preconditions (P6 done → old repo's finals done → editable swap), the copy
  inventory, and a result field per check — so start.md can be deleted without losing
  the verification protocol. It gates DESIGN.md work and is itself deleted when all
  checks pass. Referenced from STATUS.md next-actions and CLAUDE.md docs list.

  Added independence check to MIGRATION.md (maintainer call: zero functional references
  to the old repo — code must live here; provenance naming in comments/docs stays, the
  charter requires it). Ran it: one functional hit, fixed — `rl/common/logging.py`
  `WANDB_PROJECT` "deep-rl-from-scratch" → "pokemon-showdown-rl". No old-repo paths in
  copied runs/ artifacts or anywhere else in code. Note: W&B runs now land under the
  new project name; old-repo W&B history stays under the old one.

- 2026-08-04 — Final sweep of the old repo (maintainer request): gaps found and closed

  Verified: rl/, scripts/, tests/, configs/, prior_work/, assets/ all match the source
  file-by-file (pycache/.DS_Store excluded); showdown/.git came across (pin provenance);
  old HANDOFF.md is the empty stub (nothing mid-handoff).

  Rescued (~6.3GB; all finished, live P6 dirs untouched — start.md §0 says the old
  session will strip the capstone from the old repo, so result-backing checkpoints were
  at risk): showdown_r512_lra_s{0,1,2} (P5b best RL 0.4433), showdown_r512_s{0,1,2}
  (P5 control 0.3923), showdown_scratch12m_s{0,1,2} (12M flat 0.417), bc_p4_512_s{0,1,2}
  + bc_p4_512_sub10k (P4 scaling arms). All diffed file-by-file post-copy: match.

  Knowledge from old STATUS.md not previously carried over (now in STATUS.md watch):
  annealed checkpoints cannot be warm-extended — a 12M anneal arm runs from scratch with
  lr_anneal_steps: 12000000; poke-env 0.15.0 SH setup-branch upstream bug, report
  unfiled; inherited backlog — decompose collect via `scripts/showdown_throughput.py a`
  (last ran 2026-07-30 on the 10-dim placeholder encoder, pre-611-dim; an encode timer
  must NOT go in shared code — `embed_battle` is inside `ShowdownSingles`, and a
  `hasattr` branch in `rl/train.py` is what the masking contract bans). Also noted:
  P5b per-seed 0.416/0.468/0.446 — s0 is the recurring weak seed; watch seed spread.

  Left in the old repo by decision (recorded in MIGRATION.md): all pre-migration md
  docs/history, top-level wandb/ and logs/, live P6 dirs, and
  .claude/agents/doc-archaeologist.md — flagging for the maintainer whether to adapt it
  here (its protocol targets the old repo's PLAN_ARCHIVE/SESSION_LOGS).

- 2026-08-05 — P6 COMPLETE and CREDITED (from the old repo; recorded here as the durable copy)

  Distilled from the old repo's final SESSION_LOGS entry (written at close-out from run
  artifacts) — which CORRECTS two mechanism claims in P6_RESULTS.md; where they differ,
  this entry and the old log win.

  Design: flat vs annealed LR at 12M on r512, 3 seeds/arm, 6-wide; arms seed-UNPAIRED
  by necessity (flat s0/s1/s2, annealed s3/s4/s5 — the collision landmine). Annealed =
  linear 2.5e-4 → 0 over 12M, from scratch. 6/6 lanes completed (425,265–431,269 rows,
  62 ckpts each); R0 gates passed on all six.

  Finals (locked protocol): flat 0.425/0.424/0.450 → pooled 0.4330; annealed
  0.449/0.451/0.482 → pooled **0.4607**. Delta +0.0277, z = 2.16 → **CREDITED, clearing
  the line by 0.003** where the 6M read cleared by double. Direction replicates,
  magnitude does not. Recorded caveat, not re-litigation: seed-level Welch t ≈ 2.03,
  p ≈ 0.12; both arms carried by one strong seed. Per-seed cross-arm comparison is
  meaningless (unpaired); the pooled test never assumed pairing.

  What it moves: first RL result past the BC clone (0.453); 0.028 under the 0.489
  mirror ceiling; P4's training-side gap is CLOSED. Flat 6M→12M = +0.0407, so raw
  budget bought as much as the anneal; annealed 6M→12M only +0.017. Undercuts DESIGN.md
  Arms A premise — revision 5 banner merged there from the old repo's revision 4.

  Mechanism (corrected vs P6_RESULTS.md): approx_kl second-half flat 0.00554 vs
  annealed 0.00167 — 3.3× (NOT "halved"); annealed decays monotonically by quarter
  (0.00468/0.00367/0.00233/0.00101) vs trendless flat. clip_frac 0.0569 vs 0.0206
  (2.8×), newly recorded. Entropy DID separate — clean 3-vs-3 rank split (annealed
  0.2541–0.2746 below flat 0.2773–0.2817) — but only ~6.5%; the pre-registered tell
  (entropy collapse) did not occur. Loop split held 94.8/5.2 over the full 12M.

  Artifacts now here: runs/showdown_r512_12m_s{0,1,2}, runs/showdown_r512_lra12m_s{3,4,5}
  (rsynced, row counts verified vs source), runs/p6_finals_logs/ (the six gitignored
  finals_*.log the numbers are sourced from — they were on the old repo's deletion
  list). P6 is done; it never needs re-running.

- 2026-08-05 — Two maintainer decisions: history import approved; public-repo rule relaxed

  Git history: import the capstone's commit lineage from the old repo as this repo's
  root — path-filtered to the ported files + cut at capstone start (2026-07-25) with a
  squashed baseline commit, capstone-era commits on top, bootstrap commit above that.
  Run only after the old session commits P6 finals + result. Hash rewrite accepted for
  the import ("fine for the history import, we can be strict going forward"). Full plan
  in MIGRATION.md.

  Public-repo strictness relaxed: the "no personal details in committed files — may go
  public" obligation drops to "keep secrets out"; local paths etc. are fine. Updated in
  CLAUDE.md (charter), DESIGN.md §10 (license caveat reworded; not committing unlicensed
  data still stands). MIGRATION.md check 2's `/Users/` grep stays — it guards old-repo
  independence, not privacy.

  Not done yet, blocked on the P6 run finishing (~02:00–02:30): `pytest tests/`,
  deleting `start.md`, first commit. P6's result arrives via separate handover.
